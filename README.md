# Hunt or Get Hunted
## Description
Kidnappings have been reported in your neighborhood. You've heard whispers of children coming from your unknown neighbor next door and suspect something is very amiss in this old, eerie house than meets the eye. You decide to break in after dark and look for the source of those whispers, but, to your surprise, the alarm has just went off and now the element of suprise is no longer on your side. Find those stolen kids before the kidnapper finds you.

## How-To-Play
- Use the keys 'n' (north/up), 'w' (west/left), 'e' (east/right), and 's' (south/down) to move.
- Pay attention to the given clues to navigate through the house rooms:
  - The kids: Hushed cries
  - The kidnapper: Quiet breathing
  - The rats: Scurrying
  - Running to another room: Paranoia
